This script is a basic web scraper that retrieves product information from an Amazon product page and saves it in an Excel file.

The script starts by importing the required libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas). It then makes a request to an Amazon product page using the requests library and a specified User-Agent header. The response is then parsed using the BeautifulSoup library and stored in a soup object.

Next, the script extracts the following information from the soup object:

Title of the product
Price of the product
ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) of the product
URL of the product image
The script then loops through the product details section and extracts the key-value pairs of information into a dictionary, where the keys are the product details and the values are their respective descriptions.

Finally, the extracted information is stored in a pandas DataFrame and saved to an Excel file named "product_info.xlsx".

Note: The script uses HTML tags and CSS selectors to locate the specific elements on the page. These selectors may not work if Amazon changes the structure of its product pages.
